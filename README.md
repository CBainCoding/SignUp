- Project overview
This is a website designed for users to be able to sign up with an account that is then visible to admins. Users can create, view their account details, edit and delete their account all from the front-end. There is an FAQs page which ordinary users can access while staff-level users can again, create, edit and delete FAQs from the front end. Once users log in they can send in an enquiry which is visible to admins in the back-end and is tied to a user account.

- Known Bugs
Delete FAQ message not showing when a user deletes from the front-end. For some reason while the messages work when creating and editing the FAQs page, the delete message does not show.
Same email address is allowed on multiple accounts when signing up. This can be solved but was left as it is for users signing up as some club members may sign themselves and their children up on different accounts
